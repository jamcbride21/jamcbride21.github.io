            From there we walked around Desa park and even had our first <span id="kiss"> kiss</span> on that date.<br>
            Since then, we met off and on Jacob was traveling. The more time we spent together the more time Jacob also spent in Malaysia. <br>
            After growing closer we decided to go on a vacation together to Cambodia and spend a few weeks at Angkor Wat and the beech in Koh Rong.

            <p class="main-p">Year 2 was a little harder for us. Jacob was finishing up his walk-a-bout 
            was again living in The States. However, the universe was <strong>not</strong> going to defeat us.<br>
            Jacob moved to China and throughout that year Hayley visited China a few times and Jacob also met up with Hayley in Vietnam. <br>
            Once Jacob's China contract was done Jacob visited Hayley in Malaysia before returing home to visit the McBride family. <br> 
            The rest of this year was Jacob renewing his passport and preparing to move to Malaysia and rent an apartment with Hayley. <br>

        <h2 class="year" id="heading-year-three"><span class="headings">Year 3</span></h2>
        <p class="main-p">Year 3 was again a fun and tough year for the both of us. <br>
            We moved into our own apartment in Penang, Malaysia. 3 months later Jacob proposed to Hayley <br>
            in Penang Botantical Gardens. From there we started to plan our legal wedding focusing on the legal paperwork<br>
            of Malaysia then having a ceremony for both of families after. After becoming legally married in Malaysia Jacob's visa <br>
            was about to exprire to we went on a short honeymoon back to were we fell in love, Cambodia. <br>
            The universe had other plans in mind as while we were in the air all the borders closed and we were stuck in Cambodia. <br>
            We decided we might as well finish our honeymoon as most of it was already paid for and the beach was still pristine. <br>
            We lived in Sihanoukville for a few months until we decided it was safe enough to move to the capital. <br> 
            In the capital, Phnom Penh, we were able to buy enough electronics to start working free-lance online. <br>
            We met a lot of friends and interesting people in Phnom Penh and also found ways to expand our online bussiness presence <br>
            while also having fun together making an awesome time of a horrible global period.

        <h2 class="year" id="heading-year-four"><span class="headings">Year 4</span></h2>
        <p class="main-p">Year 4 has been happening since I stared creating this website. Year 4 of our relationship starts with us moving to a new apartment<br>
            as this new apartment would be bigger and we were in need of more room to work at home. From that year 4 has so far been defined as the friend year. <br>
            Many of our friends left Cambodia to return home to their native countries. However, at the same time we have reconnected with some old friends <br>
            as well as made some new ones as well. We also decided that during this year with enough savings and we could finally start the process of moving and settling in The States.<br>
            I'm certain I will have many more updates and pictures to add to this section as the year progresses with my love, Hayley.
