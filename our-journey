            <h1>Our Journey</h1>
            <p>Our love began on May, 2nd 2017<br>
            Since then our love has continued to mature, evolve and most important, grow<br>
        </p>
        <h2 class="year">Year 1</h2>
             <p> Our first date was on May, 2nd 2017. We met at the coffee shop, Coffee Bean.<br>
            From there we walked around Desa park and even had our first <span id="kiss"> kiss</span> on that date.
            </p>
        <h2 class="year">Year 2</h2>
            <p>Year 2 was a little harder for us. Jacob was finishing up his walk-a-bout 
            was again living in The States. However, the universe was <strong>not</strong> going to defeat us.<br>
            
        </p>
        <h2 class="year">Year 3</h2>
        <p>Year 3 was again a fun and tough year for the both of us.</p>
        <ul>Highlights of Year 3</ul>
            <li>Jacob and Hayley get their first apartment</li>
            <li>Jacob and Hayley get their first pet, Snowy</li>  
            <li>We met our first friend couple, Christian and Charolette</li> 
            <li>We also got engaged this year as well while we were still living in Pengang</li> 
        <h2 class="year">Year 4</h2>
        <p>There are mixed emotions from both of us when referring to our 4 year of 
            relationship. The year started off quite fun and exciting with us getting our marriage
            license and also doing our "wedding" photoshoot. Then <span id="covid">covid</span>
            happened and our fresh marriage started out on hard mode. With Visa issues soon arriving
            we left for Cambodia to have our honeymoon in the port city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sihanoukville_(city)">Sihanoukville.</a>
            We toiled there for around 6ish months until we decided it would be best for long-term 
            goals of employeement, supplies, and visa issues if we moved to the capital city of Cambodia, Phnom Penh.
